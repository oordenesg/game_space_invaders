# game_space_invaders

 Group project with 3 other people. This game was developed using Python. This game was developed to understand the use of the Python programming language but oriented to objects. The files and documents shown here serve as an example to develop other games.
 
The objective of the game is to reach the maximum possible score by killing the enemies that approach our ship. Enemies will move depending on the level of play that was selected as well as the player's score increases. To play, you must run the main.py file in Spyder. The version works for both Windows and Mac. When you start the game, a welcome image to the game will be displayed. To continue it is necessary to press the space key. To play you must choose one of the three levels shown on the main screen. To do this you must click one of the three boxes with the levels indicated (Easy, Normal and Hard).
